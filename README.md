# MIPS-Compiler_Pipeline
GROUP PROJECT  Matthew Salemi Steven Li Escher Campie Joseph Om  12/12/18 Computer Organization Fall 2018  The purpose of this program is to simulate and show a pipeline for a given set of MIPS commands. It shows each command followed by which stage it is in for the pipeline. The simulation offers the ability to run the pipeline with or without forwarding and branch prediction. If one of these causes a hazard, the pipeline will insert a nop command and bubbles until the needed information is available.
